..begin main							% This is "\begin{document}"
To begin the document: \verb|..begin main|

A list of all keywords the transcriber can see will be at the very end of this document. 

\medskip

..begin section Theorems
To begin a section with heading ..bd{XYZ}: \verb|..begin section XYZ|

So in this case, it's \verb|..begin section Theorems|

\bigskip

To begin a type of theorem defined in the header, such as ..bd{XYZ}: \verb|..begin thm XYZ|. When you're done with the theorem, \verb|..end thm XYZ| must be used as well. 

\medskip

\verb|..begin thm Theorem|
..begin thm Theorem
This is the contents of Theorem. Notice that it does not have a counter. 
..end thm Theorem
\verb|.. end thm Theorem|

\medskip

That means it doesn't matter how many ..it{Theorem}s you have, they'll always show up as ..bd{Theorem}.

..begin thm Theorem
Here is another theorem.
..end thm Theorem

..begin thm Theorem
And another.
..end thm Theorem

On the other hand, ..it{Lemma}s have a counter, since it was defined without the asterisk. 

\medskip
\verb|..begin thm Lemma|
..begin thm Lemma
Yes, I know this isn't a lemma, but see how there's a counter?
..end thm Lemma
\verb|.. end thm Lemma|
\medskip

And since ..it{Note} shares the same counter as ..it{Lemma}, the counter will change whenever we define
a new ..it{Note} or ..it{Lemma}. 

\medskip
\verb|..begin thm Note|
..begin thm Note
Hello World! New counter!
..end thm Note
\verb|..end thm Note|
\medskip

..begin thm Lemma
Counter changes again!
..end thm Lemma

However, ..it{Corollary}s are defined to be subordinate to ..it{Lemma} counters, take a look. 

\medskip
\verb|..begin thm Corollary|
..begin thm Corollary
Hello, I'm a corollary. 
..end thm Corollary
\verb|..end thm Corollary|
\medskip

..begin thm Corollary
What a coincidence, me too!
..end thm Corollary

Once the "superior" counter changes, in this case ..it{Lemma}, ..it{Corollary}s' counter will also change.

..begin thm Note
Our counter changed!
..end thm Note

..begin thm Corollary
It should be self-explanatory why my counter is the way it is now. 
..end thm Corollary

\bigskip
To begin a theorem ..bd{XYZ} with specific heading ..bd{..ABC DEF}: \verb|..begin thm XYZ ..ABC DEF|. To end the theorem, using \verb|..end thm XYZ| is enough. 

\medskip
\verb|..begin thm Theorem Stoke's Theorem|
..begin thm Theorem Stoke's Theorem
For a closed surface oriented counter-clockwise, 
..begin eq
\int\limits_C \vec{F} ..dot d\vec{r} = \iint\limits_S (..del ..cross \vec{F}) ..dot d..bd{S}
..end eq
..end thm Theorem
\verb|..end thm Theorem|
\medskip

..begin thm Note Some arbitrary title
It works for ..it{Note}, ..it{Lemma}, etc.
..end thm Note
\verb|..end thm Note|

..begin subsection Proofs
\verb|..begin subsection Proofs|

To begin a subsection ..bd{XYZ}, use \verb|begin subsection XYZ|. You can also have subsubsections, subsubsubsections, etc.

To create a proof, surround the contents of the proof with \verb|..begin proof| and \verb|..end proof|

\bigskip

..bd{Claim:} an irrational number raised to an irrational power can be rational. 

\medskip
\verb|..begin proof| 
..begin proof

Notice that $\sqrt{2} \in \mathbb{R}$, $\notin \mathbb{Q}$. Therefore, we know that $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \in \mathbb{R}$ but can be $\in \mathbb{Q}$ or $\notin \mathbb{Q}$.

Suppose $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \in \mathbb{Q}$, we're done.

Suppose $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}} \notin \mathbb{Q}$, we can then use this value and raise it to another power of $\sqrt{2}$. 

\[ (\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}})^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2} * \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2 \in \mathbb{Q} \]
..end proof
\verb|..end proof|

..begin section Lists

Lists can be nested. 

Do this to create a bullet-point (unnumbered) type of list: \verb|..begin list bullet|.

As expected?, \verb|..end list| must be used at the very end. 
..begin list bullet
.. For each item in the list, it must be on a separate line, and it must be preceded with a \verb|.. |.
.. item 1.
.. item 2. 
this will go to the end of item 2, and not be in a new line, because it's missing \verb|.. | in the beginning.
.. item 3.
..n Notice that this doesn't have the bullet point in front, because a newline character is used instead of \verb|.. |
.. item 4.
.. ..bd{To create an ordered list, use} \verb|..begin list|
..begin list
.. this one is ordered. 
..begin list
.. and another nested list!
..end list
.. just remember to end as many lists as you started.
..end list

or it'll be embarassing, just like this here...

..end list
\verb|..end list|

Oops, wrong indentation! 

Or better yet, it'll transcribe correctly,
but will not ..bd{compile} correctly if a \verb|..end list| is missing!

It might be helpful to indent the lists in the code, so you won't forget what level of indentation you're on. LaTeX is great in the sense that indentation doesn't matter ..it{that} much. 

..begin thm Note
The transcribed .tex files will automatically be indented wherever there are items in a list. 
..end thm Note

..begin section Equations

LaTeX's equation mode honestly sucks. You can't have a blank line while in equation .. gather .. align mode. This means that a reasonable person expecting to create a new line would get a ridiculous error like missing \verb|$| inserted. The only way to create a line break would be using \verb|\\|, which I think is a lot less intuitive than it should be.

\medskip

This transcriber will assume all new lines within the gather or align mode are supposed to be in a new line compared to the previous and following line. This means that there is no need to insert \verb|\\| at the end of each line, but it also means that the only way to continue on the same line in the compiled pdf is to put the equation in the same line. Blank lines will be automatically removed, so feel free to leave blank lines in the file to be transcribed. 

\medskip

Only two modes are implemented: ..bd{align} and ..bd{gather}. I honestly don't know what the difference between ..bd{gather} and ..bd{equation} are, so I'm only implementing ..bd{gather}. ..bd{Align} mode allows you to select a symbol, usually the equal sign, to be aligned to other equations; ..bd{gather} mode centers all the equations. Check this document for help if necessary. ..bd{To select which symbol you want to align with in align mode, prepend the symbol with a \& sign.} Most of the time, gather mode will be used. 

\medskip

By default, ..bd{gather} mode, and non-numbering mode is used. Enable ..bd{align} by putting the word ..it{align} in it. Enable ..bd{numbered} mode by putting ..it{number} in it. 

\medskip

Here's the ..bd{gather} mode with no numbering: ..n
\verb|..begin eq|
..begin eq
a = b + c
d = e + f
a + d = b + c
..end eq
\verb|..end eq|

\medskip

Here's the ..bd{align} mode with no numbering: ..n
\verb|..begin eq align|
..begin eq align
h &..set 2x + 3y + 4z		&	2u + &2v = 10

x &= y						&	&2v + 4w = 20

a &= b + c					&	2b + 2c + &7v = 30\\
f(x, y) &= g(a, b, c)		&	&2v = 4z

..end eq
\verb|..end eq|

\medskip

Here's the ..bd{gather} mode with numbering: ..n
\verb|..begin eq number|
..begin eq number
a = b
2x + 4c = 10
10 + 4c = 20
..end eq
\verb|..end eq|

\medskip

Here's how to do ..bd{align} with numbering: ..n
\verb|..begin eq align number|
..begin eq align number
a &= b + c
a &= 2b + d
a &= 3c + e
..end eq
\verb|..end eq|

..begin section Text Alignment

By default, all text are flushed left. However, it is possible to change it to be flushed right, centered, justified, etc. Use the following to set alignment. 

..align center
\verb|..align center|..n
This is a line of text that is centered. 

..align right
\verb|..align right|..n
This is a line of text that is flushed right. 

..align justify
\verb|..align justify|..n
